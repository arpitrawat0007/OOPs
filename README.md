OOPs Practical Hub

Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts and Data Structures (DS) using C!


Project Overview


This repository showcases my journey through the fundamentals of OOPs, Data Structures, and Algorithms (DSA) using C programming language. With a collection of practical exercises and projects, I've demonstrated my understanding of OOPs concepts, DS implementation, and problem-solving skills.



Code. Learn. Repeat.


Dive into the world of OOPs, DS, and DSA using C with this practical hub!

Technologies Used


- C: Programming language for implementation
- OOPs: Object-Oriented Programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- DS: Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal)



Key Concepts


- OOPs concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- DS implementation (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- DSA (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
- Problem-solving skills using C programming


Getting Started

1. Explore the practicals, data_structures, and algorithms folders
2. Run the C programs and test the implementations
